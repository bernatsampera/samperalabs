# Fix Plan

<!-- SETUP AGENT: Only populate this file with tasks, then STOP. Do NOT execute any tasks. They will be run by `npm start`. -->

## High Priority

<!-- Add your tasks here, one per line with [ ] checkbox -->
<!-- Example: -->
<!-- - [ ] Read config.json and update the timeout value to 30 -->
<!-- - [ ] Create a new file data/output.txt with the processed results -->

## Completed

- [x] Project setup

## Notes

- Tasks are completed ONE at a time by the agent
- Be specific: describe exactly what to read, what to do, and what to write
- Mark tasks complete with [x] after verification
- Just one iteration for task. Exit after completing the task.
