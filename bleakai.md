## BleakAI â€” Making Generative AI Simple

Generative AI lets computers create â€” text, code, designs, and ideas. Itâ€™s powerful, but integrating it into real products often feels complicated. Developers spend time wiring APIs, managing prompts, and building interfaces that let users interact with AI in meaningful ways.

**BleakAI** was built to simplify that.
It helps creators add generative AI to their apps in a way that feels natural â€” keeping humans in control while the AI does the work underneath.

### How it works

BleakAI runs on top of **LangGraph**, a system that connects different AI tools into a visual flow.
You can imagine it as a chain of connected steps:

```
[ Start ] â†’ [ AI Tool ] â†’ [ UI Element ] â†’ [ Human Input ] â†’ [ Next Step ] â†’ [ Result ]
```

Each **tool** performs a specific AI task â€” like generating text, analyzing content, or refining a response.
Each **UI element** represents a moment where the process pauses and asks for your input. You can adjust, approve, or redirect what happens next.

When you confirm, the flow continues automatically, moving through the graph until it reaches the final result.

This approach keeps the power of automation while preserving **human judgment** at key points. Itâ€™s AI you can collaborate with â€” not just run.

BleakAI is evolving, but its mission stays clear:
to make generative AI practical, modular, and effortless to use.
